WGS Extract Beta v4
https://WGSE.bio/

Congratulations on downloading the WGS Extract v4 Installer.

There is more detailed information in the user manual available at
https://WGSE.bio/. As well as the Release_Notes.txt file here.

Click on the appropriate installer script for your computer :
    Microsoft Win10/11      	Install_windows.bat
    Apple MacOS X/11/12     	Install_macos.command
    Ubuntu Linux (18/20/22)	  Install_ubuntu.sh
    Generic Linux             Install_linux.sh

Right-Click (Windows) or CTRL-Click (MacOS) the first time to go
 though their approval process for your OS. After that, you can simply
 click the script file directly to start. Some OS's have this extra level
 of protection applied to applications not sourced through their app store.

If on a MacOS, drag the WGSExtractv4/ folder (result after unzipping) into
 /Applications or maybe your Home folder.  On Windows, drag to your Users
 Home folder or another disk. The Home folder is one up from the Downloads
 folder. You cannot leave the WGS Extract installation in the Downloads/
 or Documents/ folders; programs usually cannot work from there. (note:
 depending on your version of Windows, you can drag WGSExtractv4/ to the
 "Program Files" folder.)

If upgrading, copy the files and folders from the expanded WGSExtractv4/ folder
 onto the same directory as your current installation.  Overwriting or replacing
 any same-named files there.  Then simply (re)run the Installer named above.

You can rename the installation directory, if you desire, to other than WGSExtractv4.

Installers are re-entrant. They will update tools, libraries and packages of
 the WGS Extract program when run again.

We try to make sure a script starts in a visible Terminal / cmd.exe window when
 you click to start it from your GUI / Finder / Explorer.  But it does not always
 work. On all platforms, starting the script from a Terminal / cmd.exe shell
 will always get the Terminal window to see any log of actions.  To start
 a script in Win10/11, you "call" a .bat file.  In all others, simply type
 "bash" and then give the full script file name.

The actual WGS Extract Program package installation is only a minute whereas
 the Reference Library and tools packages may take 15 minutes to an hour or
 more; depending on your internet connection speed. Each is over 500 MB in size.

Once installed successfully, start the WGS Extract program by clicking on the
 Start script for your computer (only one of them should exist):
    Microsoft Win10/11      WGSExtract.bat
    Apple MacOS X/11/12     WGSExtract.command
    Linux (& Ubuntu LTS)    WGSExtract.sh

Make an alias / shortcut of the Start script file and put it wherever convenient
 (desktop, Application folder, Start menu, etc). You cannot copy it as the script
 location indicates where the installation is. How you make an alias / shortcut
 is different for each OS. Search the internet or see the Installation chapter
 in the WGS Extract Users Manual for more details: https://WGSE.bio/

There is a Library script (similar to the Start script) to run just the
 reference genome library management tool. This is a convenience when you know
 a specific reference genome is needed.  Otherwise, the program will download
 when it is needed and missing.

There is a corresponding Uninstall_xxxx.xxx script for each OS type to completely
 remove the installation and everything it installed.
