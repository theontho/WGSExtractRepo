Items in `sandbox` should not be reviewed or read until ready.  Or at least you should not feel like you have to read them, feel free to read them for fun.  We could make them a separate branch, but that creates extra merge work.

`sandbox/` items might be abandoned, radically changed, or otherwise.  Don't worry about breaking code in here.  They are probably written with AI so they will be messy and verbose at first, then cleaned up. 

Mac tends to go in this order:

1. Make it work
2. Make it right  <- this is refactors, getting rid of uglyness, copy / pasting, etc.
3. Make it fast (if needed)
